# Art-Museum-Project


In this project, I will create React components to build a purely frontend application that displays a list of art galleries. Using the React Router library, I will enable a user to navigate through the different art galleries to see images and descriptions of their respective art pieces. The information about the art galleries will be seeded using data extracted from the Harvard Art Museum API.

By the end of the project, I will use the following React Router components and hook:

BrowserRouter
NavLink
Link
Route
Switch
useParams
I will also specify unique keys when creating arrays of JSX elements to render.
